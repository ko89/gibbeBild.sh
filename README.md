Bash-Script for downloading photos uploaded to twitter
======================================================

This script automatically downloads photos, if feeded with a twitter-URL.


Supported Platforms
-------------------

Should work under all *nix-Environments.
Needs curl, wget, sed and cut, so please install them.


Usage
-----
In the shell, type "~$ gibbeBild.sh -a [twitter-URL]" or  "~$ gibbeBild.sh -u [twitter-URL]" from the directory your stored gibbeBild.sh.
If you have the script deep within a folder-history, consider adding "alias gibbeBild='[path/to/script]/gibbeBild.sh'" to your .bashrc, so you can run it from anywhere in your shell quickly.
